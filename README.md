# Needy Girl Extra Modding Libraries

A group of libraries for that might help in modding Needy Girl Overdose/Needy Streamer Overload via BepInEx plugins.

Some libraries are slightly outdated, but most of these can be used to make modding the game easier.

Currently tested with **version 1.1.1** of the game

WIP!

## Compiling With Other Versions of the Game

To compile these libraries yourself, after cloning the repo, just open the project file then go to "Build Solution" in the Projects Section.
To compile to other versions of the game, make sure in your References you use the appropriate Unity libraries with the version the game is built on and the appropriate AssemblyCSharp located in.
It is highly recommended to get the unstripped versions of Unity libraries rather than taking everything from the Managed Folder.

### Unity Versions
**For version 1.4.0:** (2022.3.42, Mac only)

**For version 1.2.1+:** (2022.3.15)

**For any version before 1.2.1:** (2021.2.1)

## Disclosure

This library was unfortunately created using Visual Studio 2022 with Intellicode (Ai-powered autocomplete)
